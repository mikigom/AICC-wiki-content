# Common Customer Complaints

Use this as an internal quick-reference when handling complaints. Do not copy as-is; adapt to the customer’s situation and conversation context.

---

# Charging/Station Availability
* **Examples:** Charger occupied or down, long queue, access blocked
* **Verify:** Station name/time, charger ID, availability at the moment, if possible
* **First response:** Acknowledge inconvenience; share current status and estimated wait or recovery time
* **Actions:** Request to wait; Offer alternative charger or time window;

# Billing/Refunds
* **Examples:** Overcharge, duplicate charge, statement mismatch, refund delay
* **Verify:** Billing period, amount, payment method, receipts/invoices
* **First response:** Confirm we are reviewing the ledger for the period; provide an expected resolution timeline
* **Actions:** File a correction; initiate refund if confirmed; follow up until funds are posted

# Equipment/Service Quality
* **Examples:** Charger error, car wash malfunction, unstable session
* **Verify:** Device/charger name/ID, error code/message, occurrence time/frequency, photos/video
* **First response:** Request for contacting staff; arrange on-site/remote check
* **Actions:** Schedule repair/replacement; offer alternative service where possible

# Staff/Store Experience
* **Examples:** Unfriendly service, missing guidance, excessive waiting without updates
* **Verify:** Location, staff role (if known), date/time, specific statements or actions
* **First response:** Express regret; confirm we’ll share internally and prevent recurrence
* **Actions:** Log and forward to ops;

# Smoking/Odor at Facilities (Restroom, Charging Bays)
* **Examples:** Cigarette smell in restroom, smoke near chargers/queuing area
* **Verify:** Exact location, time, whether the smoker is still present
* **First response:** Apologize and confirm smoke-free/smoking-zone policy; state that you’ll escalate cleaning and monitoring immediately
* **Actions:** Arrange deodorizing/ventilation; record incident for repeat-offender tracking

# Trash/Station Cleanliness
* **Examples:** Full bins not emptied, littered charging space, dirty waiting areas
* **Verify:** Location and area (e.g., charger number, lounge, restroom), time, photos if available
* **First response:** Apologize; notify that we will check a status and cleanup again

# Restroom Supplies/Location
* **Examples:** No soap or toilet paper, confusion about restroom location or gender-specific facilities
* **Verify:** Restroom location, men’s/women’s designation
* **First response:** Apologize; confirm restocking is underway.
* **Actions:** Notify staff to restock immediately; audit other supplies;

# Post-Charge Blocking
* **Examples:** Fully charged vehicle still occupying charger; queue forming because of blocking
* **Verify:** Charger number, charge session status and end time.
* **First response:** Apologize for the delay; explain our idle/overstay policy and that we’re contacting the driver/on-site staff
* **Actions:** Ping driver via app/SMS if available; notify on-site team to request move;

# Connector Stuck / Plug Won’t Disconnect
* **Examples:** Connector latch won’t release; handle locked to vehicle
* **Verify:** Charger ID, connector type, session status (active/ended), on-screen or app error codes, time of issue
* **Actions:** If unresolved, dispatch staff; instruct customer to remain with the vehicle; do not force or use tools that could damage the port

# Card Payment Failing (POS/Terminal)

* **Examples:** Tap/insert/swipe not working; repeated declines with no clear reason.
* **Verify:** Station/terminal ID, time, name.

## Common Causes (call these out explicitly)
* **Payment authorization decline on the registered payment card** (most frequent).
* **Damaged magnetic stripe on the membership card** causing the terminal to fail to read the member ID.

## Quick Resolution Steps
1. **Confirm authorization status first.**
   **Customer-facing guidance:** “Please first check whether your registered payment card was declined; if there’s no transaction record, please speak with a staff member.”
2. **If the payment card status is normal but a membership card won’t read:**
   Please contact a staff member.

## Support & Handoff
* If the card shows **declined** or the **membership card is physically damaged**, assist the customer with:
  * Notify the issue and payment card update
  * Reissuing the membership card or completing a manual lookup.
* If no authorization record exists and the issue persists, connect the customer to **staff** or **live phone support** and provide the captured details.

## Standard Opening/Closing (Use Sparingly)
* **Opening:** “I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Let me check a few details so I can help quickly.”
* **Closing after save:** “We’ve shared your case with our team. We’ll contact you after confirmation and corrective action.”

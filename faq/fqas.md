# Field FQA

## 1) “Can a ‘regular/private’ car sign up or charge here?”

**Clarify intent**

* Confirm whether “regular car” means a **non-commercial/private vehicle** (not a taxi, truck, fleet vehicle).

**What to verify**

* Vehicle use type (commercial vs. private), plate/class if applicable.
* If commercial: business registration, operator name, contact.

**First response (example)**

* “You’re welcome to charge here. Our **membership** is for **commercially licensed vehicles** (taxis, trucks, fleets). **Private vehicles** can still use the stations as **non-members** at the standard public rate.”

**Actions**

* If **commercial**: proceed with membership enrollment steps.
* If **private**: explain pay-as-you-go (non-member) flow; show where to view rates; confirm supported payment methods; offer to set a guest profile for receipts.
* Note any edge cases (e.g., ride-hail with commercial license → eligible).

## 2) Post-issuance of 신용카드매출전표 (Credit Card Sales Slip)

**What to verify**

* Charging session details: date/time, station/site, payer name/email.

**First response (example)**

* “I can help with a 신용카드매출전표 (credit card sales slip). I’ll locate the transaction and confirm the session details. You can obtain the slip via your card issuer as card usage history (카드 사용 내역), or I can issue one from our office after verification.”

**Actions**

* Locate the transaction in the ledger and confirm payer ownership.
* Provide issuance paths: Upon verification, **issue from our office** and send as a PDF via email (or share an SMS link).
* Share an expected delivery timeframe (about 1 hour).

## 3) Lost card — payment card vs. membership card

**Clarify intent**

* Ask whether the customer lost their **payment card** (credit/debit) or their **membership card** (our access card).

### A) Lost **payment card**

**What to verify**

* Customer identity, contact.

**First response (example)**

* “I’m sorry that happened. For your security, please contact your card issuer to block the card. I’ll also help update your payment method on our side.”

**Actions**

* Verify ID and **add the replacement card** when available.

### B) Lost **membership card**

**Policy**

* Reissue of a new card required.
* **Deposit / reissue fee:** **KRW 30,000 (standard).**
  * If there is **temporary-card stock from former (withdrawn) members**, issue at **KRW 20,000**. **Staff must manually confirm current stock availability.**
* For the previous membership card, the deposit is not refunded. If the previously lost card is later found and **returned**, the **deposit is refunded**.

**What to verify**

* Holder name, contact.

**First response (example)**

* “I can reissue your membership card right now. The deposit is KRW 30,000—or KRW 20,000 if we have temporary-card stock available (staff will check it out). If you find and return the missing old card later, we’ll refund that deposit for the old card.”

**Actions**

* Mark old card **lost/blocked** immediately to prevent misuse.
* **Check temporary-card stock** (from former members):
  * If available, apply **KRW 20,000**; otherwise **KRW 30,000**.
* Collect the deposit and issue a **new card ID**; update CRM/account.

# Field FQA (Internal) — Membership, Billing & Cards

Use this as a quick guide. Adapt wording to the customer, confirm facts first, and log outcomes.

---

## 1) “Can a ‘regular/private’ car sign up or charge here?”

**Clarify intent**

* Confirm whether “regular car” means a **non-commercial/private vehicle** (not a taxi, truck, fleet vehicle).

**What to verify**

* Vehicle use type (commercial vs. private), plate/class if applicable.
* If commercial: business registration, operator name, contact.

**First response (example)**

* “You’re welcome to charge here. Our **membership** is for **commercially licensed vehicles** (taxis, trucks, fleets). **Private vehicles** can still use the stations as **non-members** at the standard public rate.”

**Actions**

* If **commercial**: proceed with membership enrollment steps.
* If **private**: explain pay-as-you-go (non-member) flow; show where to view rates; confirm supported payment methods; offer to set a guest profile for receipts.
* Note any edge cases (e.g., ride-hail with commercial license → eligible).

## 2) Post-issuance of invoices/receipts

**What to verify**

* Charging session details: date/time, station/site, charger ID/session ID, amount, last 4 digits of payment card, payer name/email.
* For corporate tax invoices: legal entity name, business reg./tax ID, billing email.

**First response (example)**

* “I can help with a receipt/invoice. I’ll locate the transaction in our ledger and issue it to your email. Let me confirm the session details first.”

**Actions**

* Locate the transaction in the ledger and confirm payer ownership.
* Generate and send **digital receipt** or **tax invoice** (PDF/email or SMS link).
* If paid via third-party wallet, advise they may also retrieve a receipt there; still provide our session confirmation.
* Share an **expected delivery timeframe** and follow up once sent.

## 3) Lost card — payment card vs. membership card

**Clarify intent**

* Ask whether the customer lost their **payment card** (credit/debit) or their **membership card** (our access card).

### A) Lost **payment card**

**What to verify**

* Customer identity, contact.

**First response (example)**

* “I’m sorry that happened. For your security, please contact your card issuer to block the card. I’ll also help update your payment method on our side.”

**Actions**

* Temporarily disable/unlink the old card from the account.
* Verify ID and **add the replacement card** when available.
* Confirm no unauthorized sessions after the reported loss; escalate any disputes to billing review.

### B) Lost **membership card**

**Policy**

* Reissue of the new card required. **Deposit: KRW 30,000.**
* For the previous membership card, the deposit fee is not refuned. If the previously lost card is later found and **returned**, the **deposit is refunded**.

**What to verify**

* Holder name, contact.

**First response (example)**

* “I can reissue your membership card today. There’s a KRW 30,000 deposit; if you find and return the old card later, we’ll refund that deposit for the old card.”

**Actions**

* Mark old card **lost/blocked** immediately to prevent misuse.
* Collect deposit and issue a **new card ID**; update CRM/account.
* Provide pickup/shipping option and estimated availability; confirm the refund path if the old card is returned.

## Standard opening/closing (use sparingly)

* **Opening:** “I’m sorry for the trouble. Let me confirm a few details so I can fix this quickly.”
* **Closing after save:** “I’ve updated your case and shared it with our team. We’ll follow up once everything is confirmed/complete.”

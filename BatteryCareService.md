# Battery Care Service

## What is the Battery Care Service?

- PITIN’s Battery Care Service for commercial EVs (taxis and freight) is the first of its kind in Korea. It is an insurance service that provides comprehensive compensation for accidents, self-inflicted damage, flooding, and fire.
1. Accident damage: If the battery is damaged due to an unexpected accident, we take ownership of the damaged battery and provide a refurbished battery restored to like-new condition. Enjoy peace of mind with reduced costs while maintaining vehicle safety even after accident damage.
2. Self-inflicted damage: Our care service also covers battery damage caused by driver error. We take ownership of the damaged battery and provide a refurbished battery restored to like-new condition, so you can operate safely without unnecessary expense.
3. Flood damage: If the battery is damaged by flooding, we take ownership of the damaged battery and provide a refurbished battery restored to like-new condition, minimizing costs and ensuring safe operation.
4. Fire damage: If the battery is totally destroyed by fire, we compensate the residual value of the battery in cash, up to KRW 10,000,000—reducing financial burden and helping you get back on the road quickly.

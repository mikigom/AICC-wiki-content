# Common Customer Complaints

Use this as an internal quick-reference when handling complaints. Do not copy as-is; adapt to the customer’s situation and conversation context.

---

## Charging/Station Availability

* **Examples:** Charger occupied or down, long queue, access blocked
* **Verify:** Station name/time, charger ID, availability at the moment, if possible
* **First response:** Acknowledge inconvenience; share current status and estimated wait or recovery time
* **Actions:** Request to wait; Offer alternative charger or time window;

## Billing/Refunds

* **Examples:** Overcharge, duplicate charge, statement mismatch, refund delay
* **Verify:** Billing period, amount, payment method, receipts/invoices
* **First response:** Confirm we are reviewing the ledger for the period; provide an expected resolution timeline
* **Actions:** File a correction; initiate refund if confirmed; follow up until funds are posted

## Equipment/Service Quality

* **Examples:** Charger error, car wash malfunction, unstable session
* **Verify:** Device/charger ID, error code/message, occurrence time/frequency, photos/video
* **First response:** Provide basic troubleshooting steps; arrange on-site/remote check
* **Actions:** Schedule repair/replacement; offer alternative service where possible

## Membership/Card Deposit

* **Examples:** Card not working, deposit not refunded after cancellation, plan misunderstanding
* **Verify:** Membership ID, enrollment/cancellation date, deposit payment proof
* **First response:** Explain current membership status and deposit policy; confirm refund pipeline
* **Actions:** Trigger card re-issue or refund workflow as applicable; provide timeline; Note that deposit for membership card is not refunded if the card is missing because it is our own asset.

## Staff/Store Experience

* **Examples:** Unfriendly service, missing guidance, excessive waiting without updates
* **Verify:** Location, staff role (if known), date/time, specific statements or actions
* **First response:** Express regret; confirm we’ll share internally and prevent recurrence
* **Actions:** Log and forward to ops;

## Smoking/Odor at Facilities (Restroom, Charging Bays)

* **Examples:** Cigarette smell in restroom, smoke near chargers/queuing area
* **Verify:** Exact location (stall/bay number), time, whether the smoker is still present, any signage issues, photos if safe
* **First response:** Apologize and confirm smoke-free/smoking-zone policy; state that you’ll escalate cleaning and monitoring immediately
* **Actions:** Notify on-site staff to intervene; increase patrols and signage visibility; arrange deodorizing/ventilation; record incident for repeat-offender tracking

## Trash/Station Cleanliness

* **Examples:** Full bins not emptied, littered bays, dirty waiting areas
* **Verify:** Location and area (bay number, lounge, restroom), time, severity (bin overflowing vs. general litter), photos if available
* **First response:** Apologize; confirm a cleanup is being dispatched and give an ETA if possible
* **Actions:** Alert cleaning vendor/on-site staff; adjust service frequency; log for service-level compliance review

## Restroom Supplies/Location

* **Examples:** No soap, confusion about restroom location or gender-specific facilities
* **Verify:** Restroom location, men’s/women’s designation, fixture type (dispenser brand if known)
* **First response:** Apologize; confirm restocking is underway and provide precise directions to the nearest restroom (men/women/unisex)
* **Actions:** Notify staff to restock immediately; audit other dispensers;

## Post-Charge Blocking

* **Examples:** Fully charged vehicle still occupying bay; queue forming
* **Verify:** Bay number, vehicle description/plate (if policy allows), charge session status and end time, idle-fee policy at location
* **First response:** Apologize for the delay; explain our idle/overstay policy and that we’re contacting the driver/on-site staff
* **Actions:** Ping driver via app/SMS if available; notify on-site team to request move; apply idle/overstay fee per policy;

## Connector Stuck / Plug Won’t Disconnect

* **Examples:** Connector latch won’t release; handle locked to vehicle
* **Verify:** Charger ID, connector type, session status (active/ended), on-screen or app error codes, time of issue
* **Actions:** If unresolved, dispatch staff; instruct customer to remain with the vehicle; do not force or use tools that could damage the port

## Card Payment Failing (POS/Terminal)

* **Examples:** Tap/insert/swipe not working; repeated decline without clear reason
* **Verify:** Station/terminal ID, time, card type/network, error message;
* **First response:** Apologize; suggest immediate alternatives (app payment, QR, cashless wallet) and offer staff assistance or live phone support
* **Actions:** Guide customer to on-site staff for manual processing if allowed; provide phone support line for assisted payment; log terminal error and escalate to payments team; advise customer to check with issuer if decline persists

## Standard Opening/Closing (Use Sparingly)

* **Opening:** “I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Let me check a few details so I can help quickly.”
* **Closing after save:** “We’ve shared your case with our team. We’ll contact you after confirmation and corrective action.”
